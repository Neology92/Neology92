# 👋 Hello there!

I'm a passionate developer and technology enthusiast who believes in using tech to make people's lives better — not to manipulate or exploit.
My goal is to build healthy, inspiring spaces where everyone can thrive. 🌿  

Currently living in 🇵🇱 Poland and looking for job mainly here.

## 🧠 Interests beyond code

I'm deeply interested in the **human side of technology**:

- **Conflict resolution** and **emotional work**: Creating spaces where every voice matters
- **Ethical UX**:  
  I care about improving user experiences without manipulating users or fueling artificial needs for profit.  
  My goal is to design tools and spaces that **serve people**, not exploit them.
- Worked for a year as a **programming teacher** at a technical school.


## 🌍 What I'm looking for

I aim to work with teams and organizations that are focused on:
- **Equality** and **meeting real human needs**
- **Building sustainable and healthy environments**
- **Rejecting market practices that profit from creating artificial demands**
